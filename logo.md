**Prompt:**

Minimalist flat logo for "Dirework", a self-hosted Pomodoro timer and task list app for Twitch streamers. The logo combines a stylized wolf silhouette with a circular timer/progress ring element. The wolf face is geometric and modern, facing forward, with the timer ring wrapping around or integrated into the design. Use a dark background (#1c1c1e) with a bright green accent (#34c759) for the timer ring and clean white (#f5f5f7) for the wolf. No text in the logo itself. Simple, bold, recognizable at small sizes. SVG-friendly clean shapes. Suitable for a favicon, app icon, and documentation header.

**Variations to try:**

1. **Icon only:** Wolf head inside a circular progress ring (like an app icon)
2. **Wordmark:** "DIREWORK" in Montserrat Bold with the wolf icon replacing the "D" or placed before the text
3. **Minimal:** Just the wolf head silhouette with a small progress arc accent
4. **Favicon:** Ultra-simplified wolf head that reads well at 16x16 and 32x32

**Color palette:**
- Primary: `#34c759` (green — timer/progress)
- Background: `#1c1c1e` (dark)
- Text/Icon: `#f5f5f7` (white)
- Accent: `#0a84ff` (blue — optional secondary)
