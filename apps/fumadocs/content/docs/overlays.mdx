description: How to add Dirework overlays to OBS
---

Dirework provides two overlays that you add as **Browser Sources** in OBS (or any streaming software that supports browser sources).

## Overlay URLs

After signing in, go to your **Dashboard**. In the **Overlay URLs** card you'll find two URLs:

- **Timer Overlay** — `/overlay/t/{token}`
- **Task List Overlay** — `/overlay/l/{token}`

Each overlay has a unique token. Click the copy button next to each URL to copy the full URL.

<Callout type="warn">
  Keep your overlay tokens private. Anyone with the URL can view your overlay. If a token is compromised, click the regenerate button to create a new one.
</Callout>

## Adding to OBS

1. In OBS, click the **+** button under Sources
2. Select **Browser**
3. Name it (e.g. "Dirework Timer" or "Dirework Tasks")
4. Paste the full overlay URL
5. Set the dimensions:
   - **Timer:** 250 x 250 (or match your timer style config)
   - **Task List:** 400 x 600 (adjust to fit your layout)
6. **Important:** Check **"Shutdown source when not visible"** (optional but recommended)
7. Click **OK**

## Timer Overlay

The timer overlay shows:
- Current phase label (Focus, Break, Long Break, etc.)
- Countdown timer
- Cycle count (e.g. 1/4)

The timer is transparent by default so it blends into your stream layout. The display updates in real-time via polling.

## Task List Overlay

The task list overlay shows:
- Header with "Tasks" title and completion count
- Scrolling list of viewer tasks with usernames in their Twitch color
- Checkboxes (or bullets) for task status
- Completed tasks with strikethrough text

The task list auto-scrolls when the list overflows using a dual-container infinite scroll animation.

## Customization

Both overlays are fully customizable through the dashboard configuration. You can adjust:

- **Timer:** Dimensions, background color/opacity, border radius, font family, font sizes, text color, text outline, phase labels
- **Task List:** Fonts, header/body backgrounds, border styles, task item styling, username colors, checkbox appearance, scroll speed, and more

Changes to the configuration are reflected in the overlays automatically.

## Transparent Background

The overlays render with a transparent background by default. In OBS, the browser source will show only the timer or task list widget without any background, making it easy to layer over your stream.
