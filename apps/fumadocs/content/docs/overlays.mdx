description: How to add Dirework overlays to OBS
---

Dirework provides two overlays that you add as **Browser Sources** in OBS (or any streaming software that supports browser sources).

## Overlay URLs

After signing in, go to your **Dashboard**. In the **Overlay URLs** card you'll find two URLs:

- **Timer Overlay** — `/overlay/t/{token}`
- **Task List Overlay** — `/overlay/l/{token}`

Each overlay has a unique token. Click the copy button next to each URL to copy the full URL.

<Callout type="warn">
  Keep your overlay tokens private. Anyone with the URL can view your overlay. If a token is compromised, click the regenerate button to create a new one.
</Callout>

## Adding to OBS

1. In OBS, click the **+** button under Sources
2. Select **Browser**
3. Name it (e.g. "Dirework Timer" or "Dirework Tasks")
4. Paste the full overlay URL (e.g. `http://localhost:3001/overlay/t/YOUR_TOKEN`)
5. Set the dimensions:
   - **Timer:** 250 x 250 (or match your timer style config)
   - **Task List:** 400 x 600 (adjust to fit your layout)
6. **Important:** Check **"Shutdown source when not visible"** (optional but recommended)
7. Click **OK**

## Timer Overlay

The timer overlay shows:
- Current phase label (Starting, Focus, Break, Long Break, Done)
- Countdown timer with configurable font
- Cycle count (e.g. 1/4)
- Progress ring (circle or rounded rectangle shape)

The timer automatically transitions through phases: starting (5s countdown) → work → break → work → ... → finished. No manual intervention needed once started.

### Progress Ring Shapes

The timer supports two progress ring shapes:

- **Circle** — Standard circular ring using SVG `<circle>`
- **Rounded Rectangle (Squircle)** — macOS-style rounded rectangle using SVG `<rect>` with configurable border radius (default 22%)

## Task List Overlay

The task list overlay shows:
- Header with "Tasks" title and completion count
- Tasks grouped by author — each author gets a styled card with a tinted header row showing their name and done/total count
- Individual tasks render inside their author's group container
- Checkboxes (or bullets) for task status
- Completed tasks with strikethrough text

When scroll is enabled, the task list auto-scrolls using a dual-container infinite scroll animation. Scroll can be disabled in the Theme Center to use standard overflow scrolling instead.

## Dashboard Preview

The dashboard includes live preview iframes for both overlays. Use the **Preview** toggle button on each card to show or hide the preview. Previews are hidden by default to keep the page fast.

## Customization with Theme Center

Both overlays are fully customizable through the **Theme Center** at `/dashboard/styles`. This is a visual editor with a live preview panel.

### Task List Overlay Settings

| Category | Options |
| --- | --- |
| **Display** | Show completed tasks, show count, use checkboxes, strikethrough on done, number of visible lines |
| **Fonts** | Header font, body font |
| **Scroll** | Enabled/disabled toggle, pixels per second, gap between scroll loops |
| **Header** | Height, background color/opacity, border color/width/radius, font size, font color, padding |

### Theme Presets

The Theme Center includes 11 built-in presets to get you started:

1. **Default** — Clean dark style
2. **Liquid Glass Light** — Translucent light glass
3. **Liquid Glass Dark** — Translucent dark glass
4. **Neon Cyberpunk** — Bright neon on dark
5. **Cozy Cottage** — Warm earth tones
6. **Ocean Depths** — Deep blue aquatic
7. **Sakura** — Japanese cherry blossom pink
8. **Retro Terminal** — Green-on-black terminal
9. **Minimal Light** — Clean white minimal
10. **Sunset** — Warm orange/red gradient
11. **Twitch Purple** — Twitch brand colors

Apply a preset as a starting point, then customize individual settings to match your stream.

## Transparent Background

The overlays render with a transparent background by default. In OBS, the browser source will show only the timer or task list widget without any background, making it easy to layer over your stream.

## Real-Time Updates

Both overlays use **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** for instant updates. When you start the timer, add a task, or make any change on the dashboard, the overlay updates immediately — no polling delay.

Under the hood, overlay pages subscribe to tRPC SSE endpoints (`onTimerState` / `onTaskList`). The server pushes changes as they happen via an in-process event bus.
