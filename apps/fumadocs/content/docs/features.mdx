---

Dirework is a self-hosted Pomodoro timer and task list built specifically for Twitch co-working and body-doubling streams. Here's everything it includes.

## Pomodoro Timer

A full-featured Pomodoro timer with automatic phase transitions.

- **Configurable durations** — Set work, break, and long break durations (in minutes) from the dashboard
- **Long break intervals** — Automatically triggers a long break every N cycles (configurable)
- **Cycle tracking** — Set the number of pomos per session (1-99)
- **Automatic phase transitions** — Timer moves through starting, work, break, long break, and finished phases automatically
- **Pause and resume** — Pause mid-session and resume exactly where you left off (remembers which phase you were in)
- **Skip phase** — Skip the current phase to advance to the next one
- **5-second starting countdown** — Brief countdown before work begins so you can get ready
- **Real-time OBS overlay** — Circular or rounded-rectangle progress ring with countdown, phase label, and cycle count

## Task List

A viewer-interactive task list managed through Twitch chat.

- **Chat commands** — Viewers add, edit, complete, and remove tasks with simple commands like `!task`, `!done`, `!edit`, `!remove`
- **Multiple tasks per viewer** — Each viewer can have multiple tasks, numbered for easy reference
- **Task priority** — Broadcaster tasks are pinned to the top, viewer tasks below in order
- **Broadcaster controls** — Clear all tasks, clear completed tasks, or remove a specific user's tasks
- **Author grouping** — Tasks are grouped by author, each with a styled card container showing the author's name and done/total count
- **Real-time OBS overlay** — Task list with usernames in Twitch chat colors, checkboxes, and strikethrough for completed tasks
- **Auto-scroll** — Toggleable infinite scroll animation when the list overflows the display area

## Theme Center

A visual editor for customizing your overlays, available at `/dashboard/styles`.

- **11 built-in theme presets** — Default, Liquid Glass Light, Liquid Glass Dark, Neon Cyberpunk, Cozy Cottage, Ocean Depths, Sakura, Retro Terminal, Minimal Light, Sunset, Twitch Purple
- **Timer overlay editor** — Customize dimensions, background (color, opacity, border radius), progress ring (track/fill colors, width, gap), text (color, outline, font family), font sizes (label, time, cycle), and phase labels
- **Task list overlay editor** — Customize header, body, task items, done state, checkboxes, bullets, fonts, scroll toggle/speed, and more
- **Live preview** — See changes instantly in the preview panel with an animated timer countdown toggle
- **Progress ring shapes** — Choose between circle and rounded rectangle (squircle) ring styles
- **Per-property control** — Every color, size, opacity, font, and spacing value is individually configurable

## Twitch Chat Bot

Connect a separate Twitch bot account to handle chat commands.

- **Task commands** — `!task`, `!done`, `!edit`, `!remove`, `!check` for all viewers
- **Timer commands** — `!timer start`, `!timer pause`, `!timer resume`, `!timer skip`, `!time`, `!eta`
- **Moderator commands** — `!clear`, `!cleardone`, `!adel @user` for broadcasters and mods
- **Customizable bot messages** — Configure response templates for every command
- **Command aliases** — Create custom aliases for any command
- **Separate bot account** — Uses its own Twitch account so messages come from the bot, not you

## OBS Overlays

Two transparent browser source overlays designed for OBS and streaming software.

- **Timer overlay** — Shows phase label, countdown, and cycle count with a configurable progress ring
- **Task list overlay** — Shows task list with viewer usernames, checkboxes, and auto-scroll
- **Transparent backgrounds** — Overlays render with no background, layering cleanly over your stream
- **Unique tokens** — Each overlay has a private token URL; regenerate if compromised
- **Real-time updates** — Overlays use Server-Sent Events (SSE) for instant updates with no polling delay
- **Toggle previews** — Dashboard previews can be toggled on/off to avoid slow page loads

## Dashboard

A single-page control center for your stream.

- **Timer controls** — Start, pause, resume, skip, and stop the timer with inline duration settings and info tooltips
- **Task manager** — Add, complete, edit, and remove tasks directly from the dashboard
- **Overlay previews** — Live iframe previews of both overlays (toggleable)
- **Overlay URLs** — Copy overlay URLs for OBS with one click; regenerate tokens if needed
- **Bot management** — Connect, view status, and disconnect your bot account
- **Time-of-day greetings** — Personalized greetings based on the time of day

## UI and Design

- **macOS Liquid Glass theme** — Translucent backgrounds, backdrop blur, and rounded corners inspired by macOS
- **Blue accent theme** — Blue primary and accent colors throughout the interface
- **Dark and light mode** — Toggle between themes with a simple switch in the header
- **Responsive layout** — Works on desktop and mobile
- **Glass-effect header** — Frosted glass navbar with backdrop blur and saturation

## Self-Hosted and Single-User

- **Single-user per instance** — Each streamer runs their own Dirework instance
- **Full data ownership** — Your data stays on your server
- **PostgreSQL backend** — Reliable, battle-tested database
- **Deploy anywhere** — VPS, Docker, Coolify, Railway, or any Node.js host
- **Static docs site** — Documentation builds as a static site, deployable separately
