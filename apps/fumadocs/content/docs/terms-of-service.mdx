---

**Last updated:** February 12, 2026

## Agreement

By accessing or using a DireWork instance, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these terms, do not use the service.

## Who Operates This Instance

<Callout type="warn">
**Instance operators:** Replace this section with your name or organization and contact details before deploying.
</Callout>

## Description of Service

DireWork is a self-hosted, open-source Pomodoro timer and task list application with Twitch chat integration. It is designed for co-working and body-doubling streams. Streamers log in with Twitch, connect a bot account, configure OBS overlays, and viewers interact via chat commands. Each instance is independently deployed and operated.

## Eligibility

To use DireWork, you must:

- Be at least **13 years old**, consistent with [Twitch's minimum age requirement](https://www.twitch.tv/p/en/legal/terms-of-service/).
- Have the consent of a parent or legal guardian if you are under 18.
- Have a valid Twitch account in good standing.

## Accounts and Authentication

DireWork uses Twitch OAuth for authentication. You do not create a separate account — your Twitch identity is your DireWork identity.

- You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Twitch account.
- DireWork is designed as a single-user application by default, but instance operators may configure their instance to allow multiple users.
- Do not share your overlay tokens with anyone you do not trust, as they provide unauthenticated access to your overlay pages.

## Acceptable Use

When using a DireWork instance, you agree not to:

- **Spam or abuse chat commands** — do not flood the bot with commands or use them to disrupt streams.
- **Harass others** — do not submit tasks or use commands to target, harass, or demean other users.
- **Exploit the application** — do not attempt to gain unauthorized access to the server, database, other users' data, or administrative functions.
- **Violate Twitch Terms of Service** — do not use the bot or any DireWork feature in a way that violates [Twitch TOS](https://www.twitch.tv/p/en/legal/terms-of-service/).
- **Abuse overlay tokens** — do not reverse-engineer or exploit the authentication or overlay token system for malicious purposes.

## Twitch Integration

DireWork integrates with Twitch for authentication and bot functionality. By connecting your Twitch account:

- You authorize DireWork to access your basic Twitch profile information (user ID, username, display name, profile image).
- If connecting a bot account, you authorize DireWork to read and send chat messages on behalf of that bot account.
- You can revoke DireWork's access at any time via your [Twitch Connections Settings](https://www.twitch.tv/settings/connections).
- Your use of Twitch features through DireWork must comply with the [Twitch Terms of Service](https://www.twitch.tv/p/en/legal/terms-of-service/).

## Intellectual Property

DireWork is open-source software. The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/mrdemonwolf/dirework) and is governed by its respective license. These Terms of Service govern the use of deployed DireWork instances, not the source code itself. The source code license and these terms are complementary — neither overrides the other.

## Instance Operator Responsibilities

If you deploy and operate a DireWork instance, you are responsible for:

- Securing your server and database infrastructure.
- Complying with applicable laws and regulations, including data protection laws (such as GDPR, CCPA, or other regional regulations).
- Managing user data in accordance with the [Privacy Policy](/docs/privacy-policy).
- Keeping the software updated to receive security fixes.
- Configuring appropriate access controls (such as `ALLOWED_TWITCH_IDS` to restrict login).
- Responding to user data access and deletion requests.

<Callout type="warn">
**Instance operators:** You may be subject to additional legal obligations depending on your jurisdiction. Consult with a legal professional if you are unsure about your responsibilities.
</Callout>

## Disclaimer of Warranties

DireWork is provided **"as is"** and **"as available"** without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. Neither the developers nor instance operators guarantee that the service will be uninterrupted, error-free, secure, or meet your specific requirements.

## Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, neither the developers of DireWork nor instance operators shall be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from or related to your use of the service. This includes, but is not limited to, loss of data, loss of profits, or damages resulting from service interruption.

Total liability is limited to the amount you paid for the service. As DireWork is open-source software provided free of charge, this amount is zero.

## Termination

- **By the operator** — the instance operator may terminate or suspend your access to their instance at any time, for any reason, with or without notice.
- **By you** — you may stop using the service at any time. You may also request deletion of your data from the instance operator.
- **Effect of termination** — upon termination, your right to use the instance ceases. The instance operator may delete your data in accordance with the [Privacy Policy](/docs/privacy-policy).

## Governing Law

<Callout type="warn">
**Instance operators:** Specify the governing jurisdiction for your instance here. For example: "These terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of [Your State/Country]."
</Callout>

## Changes to These Terms

These terms may be updated with new releases of DireWork. Instance operators should review the terms with each update. Continued use of a DireWork instance after changes to these terms constitutes acceptance of the updated terms. Material changes will be reflected in the "Last updated" date at the top of this page.
